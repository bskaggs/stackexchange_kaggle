I participated solo in a Kaggle competition for predicting keywords for millions of Stack Exchange questions.  I had a straightforward approach that used Lucene to build an efficient nearest-neighbor classifier.

I was first place on the leaderboard for several weeks until other people realized that the test dataset was polluted with training data.

(This code was not originally meant to be shared and is not documented.  It's meant to show that I can sling gigabytes of text around.)
